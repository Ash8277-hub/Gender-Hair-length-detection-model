# Gender-Hair-length-detection-model
. Long Hair Identification: Description: In this task, you will develop a feature to detect a person with long hair as female, even if they are male, and detect a short-haired female as male, even if they are female. The model should work exclusively for individuals aged between 20 and 30.
